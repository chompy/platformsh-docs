# Using Platform.CC for Local Development

[Platform.CC](https://gitlab.com/contextualcode/platform_cc) is a docker based local development tool built specifically for Platform.sh. It can create local development environments from the same files used to provision the Platform.sh environment (.platform.app.yaml, .platform/services.yaml, .platform/routes.yaml).

See the [README](https://gitlab.com/contextualcode/platform_cc/blob/master/README.md) for instructions on how to install Platform.CC.

Please keep in mind that Platform.CC does not fully support all of Platform.sh's languages, services, or features.
